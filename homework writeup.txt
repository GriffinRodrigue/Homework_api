Hello!
I learned a great deal about APIs and myself in this assignment. 
Some deep painful truths were exposed and its over. C'est fini. 

One visible trend from my data is that 
the a cities distance from the equator directly affects its temperature.
The highest temperatue is at the equator
and you can see the curve of the earth in the decreae in temperature.

A second trend is that on average humidity is usually between 50 and 100 percent.

I don't know what to make of the clouds but the wind is pretty light in most cities
 but at the extremes it picks up in intensity
